title: About
---

My name is KM. 
- I am skilled primarily in containers(Docker, Podman), container orchestration(Kubernetes - AWS EKS), serverless(API Gateway, Lambda), IaC frameworks(Terraform/Terragrunt, Packer), Python, PHP(Laravel, Slim), Web(VanillaJS, Vue.JS), relational databases(MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL), and NoSQL(Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, Redis, MongoDB). I am also experienced in all things AWS and am an associate level certified solutions architect. 
- I have worked as a backend and infrastructure/platform engineer both on simple as well as large complex apps. I bring unique perspectives in building software. I am happy contributing to all the above, or focusing on just one.
- I also know enough Bash, Ruby and Go to navigate large codebases, but I do not consider myself an expert in these.
- I am a big fan of open source software and I contribute/write about it when time permits.
- I am a technology enthusiast. I read, learn new technologies, create PoC and use them for solving business problems.

I am a Full stack engineer looking for a senior role(backend, full-stack or SRE/platform), primarily in AWS/Python/PHP and can learn new stuff quickly.
