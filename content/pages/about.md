Hi! My name is KM.

An introduction about myself: 
- I am skilled primarily in PHP(Laravel, Slim), Python, Web(VanillaJS, Vue.JS), relational databases(MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL), NoSQL(Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, Redis, MongoDB), containers(Docker, Podman), container orchestration(Kubernetes - AWS EKS), serverless(API Gateway, Lambda, Fargate), and IaC frameworks(Terraform/Terragrunt, Packer). I am also experienced in all things AWS and am an associate level certified solutions architect. 
- I have worked as a backend and infrastructure/platform engineer both on simple as well as large complex apps. I bring unique perspectives in building software. I am happy contributing to all the above, or focusing on just one.
- I also know enough Bash, Go, Node.js, and Ruby to navigate large codebases, but I do not consider myself an expert in these.
- I am a big fan of open source software and I contribute/write about it when time permits.
- I am a technology enthusiast. I read, learn new technologies, create PoC and use them for solving business problems.

I am a polyglot engineer looking for a senior role(backend, full-stack or SRE/platform), primarily in AWS/PHP/Python and can learn new stuff quickly.
